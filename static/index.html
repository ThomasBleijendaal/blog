            This blog is going to be used as a reason to create a small application using Container Apps in Azure. I
            want to create a functioning blog system with several moving parts, all hosted in Azure Container Apps.
            These parts will probably be:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A public internet facing container that serves all content.</li>
            <li>An ingest container that pre-renders all pages (written in markdown) to html, and probably some
                compression variants too, and rss for good measure.</li>
            <li>A GitHub repo hosting all markdown, and is used by the ingest container to import all stuff.
                I'll probably also use that repo to deploy everything.
            </li>
            <li>Some storage container to host all pre-rendered pages.</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="note">
            <header>Note</header>
            <p><em>Over-engineering</em> will be the name of the game, so most things will be way too complex or even
                convoluted for what they really need to be. You're reading this blog before I've even finished the
                system, so I could have been done already.
            </p>

            I was inspired by a post on danluu.com (<a href="https://danluu.com/slow-device/">How web bloat impacts
                users with slow devices</a>), so I want to make this blog pretty bare bones and light, and keep the
            server side also very fast. The danluu website is a bit too bare bones for me, so I've added a little CSS,
            just to play around with grids.
