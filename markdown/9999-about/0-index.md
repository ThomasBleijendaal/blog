I could start out with some story about digital gardening, or how I'm going to write something here every week only to abandon it after week 2, but I'm not. I needed a little demo project for getting some experience in [Azure Container Apps](azure-container-apps/index.html). And, now that that I've made it, I'll see what I'll do with this. I've set it up to group things into themes, and the root index is just the first page of the theme I want to show as first. I've intentionally hidden all dates on this site, so it's not glaringly obvious when I haven't posted in a while.
